# Open Library Book-Database

A MongoDB-ExpressJS-ReactJS-NodeJS (MERN) stack app that uses the Open Library API. 
The app can look for book information using the ISBN, title of the book, or by using the author's name. The results are then displayed below with the option to be saved for viewing later by storing the data in a MongoDB Atlas database. That saved data can be removed from the database if desired via a delete button.
